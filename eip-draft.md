## Abstract

This EIP defines a JSON metadata format that enriches smart contracts with human-readable context at every level: contract descriptions, user-facing actions with titles and warnings, semantic type annotations for parameters, input guidance, and event/error enrichment. It layers on top of the ABI and NatSpec without replacing either, giving wallets, explorers, and dApps the information they need to present contract interactions in terms users can understand.

Actions are decoupled from the ABI: a single ABI function MAY back multiple actions (e.g. `approve`, `approve-max`, and `revoke` all calling the same `approve(address,uint256)` with different preset or hidden parameters), allowing metadata publishers to express common user intents as distinct first-class UI entries.

## Motivation

Smart contracts expose two layers of machine-readable information: the **ABI** (what functions exist and their Solidity types) and **NatSpec** (embedded source code documentation). Neither is structured to help end users understand the full scope of smart contract interactions.

When someone encounters a contract in a wallet, explorer, or dApp, they see raw function signatures like `offerPunkForSaleToAddress(uint256, uint256, address)` with no context about what happens when they call it, what the risks are, or what the parameters actually mean in human terms. A `uint256` could represent an ETH amount, a timestamp, a token ID, or a percentage in basis points. The ABI doesn't say which.

NatSpec provides basic descriptions (including user-facing `@notice` text), but it's flat text embedded in source code. It can't express semantic types, input guidance, or contract-level context, and is unavailable for unverified contracts.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### Overview

A metadata file describes a single deployed contract:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://1001-digital.github.io/contract-metadata/v1/schema.json",
  "chainId": 1,
  "address": "0xb47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb",
  "name": "CryptoPunks",
  "description": "10,000 unique collectible pixel art characters on Ethereum.",
  "image": "ipfs://QmTNgv3jx2HHfBjQX9RnKtxj2xv2xQDtbDXoRi5rJ3a46",
  "groups": { ... },
  "actions": { ... },
  "events": { ... },
  "errors": { ... }
}
```

### Top-Level Fields

#### Document Fields

| Field       | Type     | Required | Description                                                              |

#### Contract-Level Context

The following fields provide context about the contract itself. The fields `name`, `symbol`, `description`, `image`, `banner_image`, `featured_image`, `external_link`, and `collaborators` are compatible with [ERC-7572](./eip-7572.md) -- a contract-metadata document with `name` present is a valid ERC-7572 `contractURI()` response. The `theme` color model is inspired by [ENSIP-18](https://docs.ens.domains/ensip/18).

| Field            | Type     | Required | Description                                                              |

| `errors`    | `object` | OPTIONAL | Per-error metadata, keyed by name, signature, or 4-byte selector         |
| `messages`  | `object` | OPTIONAL | EIP-712 typed message metadata, keyed by primary type name               |

### Description Length

Every `description` field -- whether on the contract, an action, event, error, message, group, or parameter -- SHOULD be a single, plain-language sentence and MUST NOT exceed **120 characters**. Descriptions are rendered in space-constrained UI such as tooltips, list rows, and transaction previews, so they must stay short and scannable.

Long-form context -- history, multi-paragraph explanations, and Markdown formatting -- belongs in the contract-level `about` field, which has no length limit. Do not pack paragraphs into `description`.

  "risks": ["No upgradeability. Bugs are permanent"],

  ],

  "theme": {
    "background": "#000000",
    "text": "#ffffff",
    "accent": "#ff04b4",
    "accentText": "#ffffff",
    "border": "#333333"
  }
}
```

### Action, Event, and Error Keys

Actions are keyed by a free-form identifier matching `^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$`. The identifier is not constrained to ABI names -- it is the UI-facing label used for routing, cross-references, and variant distinction (e.g. `approve`, `approve-max`, `revoke`).

Each action resolves to the ABI function it invokes through its `function` field. When `function` is omitted, the action's id is used as the reference, so it MUST then be a valid bare function name. The `function` value uses one of three formats:

| Format            | When to use                  | Example                                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`            | No overloads, verified ABI   | `"transfer"`                                        |
| `name(type,type)` | Overloaded functions         | `"safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes)"` |
| `0xabcdef12`      | Unverified contract / no ABI | `"0xa9059cbb"`                                      |

**Bare name** is the default for verified contracts without overloaded functions. When a contract has multiple functions with the same name but different parameter types (overloads), the full Solidity-style signature MUST be used to disambiguate. For unverified contracts where no ABI is available, the 4-byte function selector (the first 4 bytes of `keccak256(signature)`) SHOULD be used.

Events and errors are keyed directly by one of the same three formats (not via an intermediate identifier). For events, the selector is the full 32-byte topic hash (`0x` + 64 hex chars). For errors, it is the 4-byte selector like functions.

Consumers SHOULD match by name first, then fall back to signature or selector lookup.

### Action Metadata

Each action entry MAY include the following fields. When the action's `function` field is omitted, the action's id (its key in the `actions` object) is used as the reference — so non-variant actions whose id matches the underlying ABI function name can omit the `function` field entirely.

```json
{
  "actions": {
    "offerPunkForSaleToAddress": {
      "title": "List Punk for Sale (Private)",
      "description": "List a punk for sale to a specific address only, at a minimum price.",
      "group": "marketplace",
      "warning": "This creates a binding offer. The buyer can purchase at any time.",
      "featured": true,
      "hidden": false,
      "intent": "List Punk #{punkIndex} for sale at {minSalePriceInWei} to {toAddress}",
      "related": ["offerPunkForSale", "buyPunk"],
      "params": {
        "punkIndex": {
          "label": "Punk",
          "description": "The punk ID to list (0-9999)",
          "type": "token-id",
          "validation": { "min": "0", "max": "9999" }
        },
        "minSalePriceInWei": {
          "label": "Price",
          "type": "eth"
        },
        "toAddress": {
          "label": "Buyer",
          "description": "Only this address can buy the punk",
          "type": "address"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `function` (string, OPTIONAL): The ABI function this action invokes. Accepts a bare name, full signature, or 4-byte selector. When omitted, the action's id is used as the reference — so `"approve": { ... }` is equivalent to `"approve": { "function": "approve", ... }`. Variants whose id differs from the underlying function (e.g. `"revoke": { "function": "approve", ... }`) MUST set this field.
- `order` (integer): Display order within the action's group. Lower numbers appear first. Actions without an `order` are sorted after ordered ones.
- `title` (string): Human-readable title for the action.
- `description` (string): A single short sentence explaining what the action does (max 120 characters -- see [Description Length](#description-length)).
- `group` (string): Key referencing a named group in the `groups` object.
- `warning` (string): Cautionary text displayed to the user.
- `featured` (boolean): If `true`, highlights this as a primary action.
- `hidden` (boolean): If `true`, suppresses the action from the default UI. If every authored action referencing a function is hidden, the function itself is hidden (no default is synthesized for it -- see [ABI-Synthesized Default Actions](#abi-synthesized-default-actions)).
- `intent` (string): Human-readable sentence template rendered with formatted parameter values.
- `related` (array of strings): Action identifiers of related actions.
- `params` (object): Per-parameter metadata, keyed by ABI parameter name.
- `value` (object): Metadata for the native currency (`msg.value`) sent with the call -- see [Transaction Value](#transaction-value).

#### Variant Actions

Multiple actions MAY target the same ABI function with different presets. This is how common user intents like "Revoke Approval" or "Approve Unlimited" become first-class UI entries:

```json
{
  "actions": {
    "approve": {
      "function": "approve",
      "title": "Approve",
      "params": {
        "spender": { "label": "spender", "type": "address" },
        "amount": { "label": "amount" }
      }
    },
    "revoke": {
      "function": "approve",
      "title": "Revoke Approval",
      "intent": "Revoke approval for {spender}",
      "params": {
        "spender": { "label": "spender", "type": "address" },
        "amount": {
          "autofill": { "type": "constant", "value": "0" },
          "hidden": true
        }
      }
    },
    "approve-max": {
      "function": "approve",
      "title": "Approve Unlimited",
      "params": {
        "spender": { "label": "spender", "type": "address" },
        "amount": {
          "autofill": { "type": "constant", "value": "115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935" },
          "hidden": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Consumers SHOULD render each action as a distinct UI entry. Authors SHOULD keep a base action (no locked parameters) alongside the variants when the generic form is still a sensible user intent, as `approve` is above.

#### Matching Calldata to Actions

Consumers that decode existing transactions (confirmation previews, history views, explorers) SHOULD resolve decoded calldata to the most specific action:

1. **Candidates.** Resolve each action's function reference to a 4-byte selector. Actions whose selector matches the calldata's selector are candidates.
2. **Locked parameters.** A parameter is _locked_ when it sets `hidden` or `disabled` and its `autofill` resolves to a value knowable at matching time. Each locked parameter is an equality constraint against the corresponding decoded argument:

   | Autofill                            | Constraint                                    |
   | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
   | `{ "type": "constant", "value": v }` | argument equals `v`                          |
   | `zero-address`                      | argument equals `0x000...000`                 |
   | `contract-address`                  | argument equals the described contract        |
   | `connected-address`                 | argument equals the transaction sender        |
   | `block-timestamp`                   | none -- MUST NOT be used as a constraint      |

3. **Selection.** Discard candidates with any failed constraint. Of the remainder, select the candidate with the most locked parameters. Break ties by lowest `order`, then by lexicographically smallest action id, so that selection is deterministic across consumers.
4. **Fallback.** If no candidate remains, fall back to an ABI-synthesized default for the function.

A base action with no locked parameters never fails a constraint, so it acts as the natural fallback for calldata that matches no variant's presets. Matching selects a *presentation* -- it is not a security guarantee, and consumers SHOULD still surface the underlying function signature (see Security Considerations).

#### ABI-Synthesized Default Actions

Consumers with access to the ABI SHOULD ensure every ABI function is reachable: for each function that no authored action references, synthesize a default action carrying no metadata beyond what is derivable from the ABI. Synthesized defaults exist per ABI function (per selector), are consumer-internal, and are never referenced by `related` or other authored cross-references.

Once any authored action references a function, no default is synthesized for that function -- the authored actions are its complete representation. Authors who want both curated variants and a plain generic form SHOULD author a base action alongside the variants (as the ERC-20 interface does with `approve` next to `approve-max` and `revoke`). Authors who want a function fully suppressed author a single action for it with `hidden: true`.

#### Parameter Input Flags

Parameters in an action MAY set two input-side flags that control how the input is rendered:

| Field      | Meaning                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hidden`   | Do not render an input; inject the `autofill` value at call time. REQUIRES `autofill`.                |
| `disabled` | Render the input but make it non-editable; display the autofilled value. REQUIRES `autofill`.         |

`hidden: true` and `disabled: true` are mutually exclusive. The input-side `hidden` is distinct from the display-side `type: "hidden"` semantic type -- one controls whether an input is rendered for writes, the other controls whether a value is rendered in read contexts.

#### Transaction Value

The arguments of a payable call do not fully describe it -- the native currency sent along (`msg.value`) is part of the user's intent too. Actions on payable functions MAY describe it with a `value` object, which supports `label`, `description`, `autofill`, `hidden`, `disabled`, and `validation` with the same semantics as parameters. The value is always denominated in wei and rendered as the `eth` semantic type.

```json
{
  "actions": {
    "deposit": {
      "title": "Wrap ETH",
      "intent": "Wrap {value} into WETH",
      "value": {
        "label": "Amount",
        "description": "The amount of ETH to wrap"
      }
    },
    "mint": {
      "title": "Mint (0.01 ETH)",
      "value": {
        "autofill": { "type": "constant", "value": "10000000000000000" },
        "disabled": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Without a `value` object, consumers SHOULD render a generic amount input for payable functions. A locked `value` (hidden or disabled with a resolvable autofill) participates in [calldata matching](#matching-calldata-to-actions) as an equality constraint against the transaction's value. The `{value}` placeholder in intent templates refers to the transaction value when the action declares a `value` object and the ABI declares no parameter named `value`; an ABI parameter of that name takes precedence.

### Semantic Types

The `type` field on a parameter is a semantic annotation that tells consumers what a value _represents_. A `uint256` in the ABI carries no meaning beyond "256-bit unsigned integer." Semantic types bridge that gap -- consumers use them to render appropriate UI for both display (read) and input (write) contexts.

#### String Types

| Type           | Meaning                                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `eth`          | Raw wei value, displayed as ETH (18 decimals) -- see Amount-like Types |
| `gwei`         | Raw wei value, displayed as gwei (9 decimals)                     |
| `timestamp`    | Unix timestamp (display: formatted date, input: date picker)      |
| `address`      | Ethereum address (with ENS resolution)                            |
| `boolean`      | Boolean value                                                     |
| `blocknumber`  | Block number                                                      |
| `duration`     | Duration in seconds                                               |
| `bytes32-utf8` | bytes32 encoding a UTF-8 string                                   |
| `token-id`     | Token ID / NFT identifier                                         |
| `percentage`   | Percentage value (0-100)                                          |
| `basis-points` | Value in basis points (1/100th of a percent)                      |
| `token-amount` | Token amount (display: formatted balance, input: with max button) |
| `date`         | Date value                                                        |
| `datetime`     | Date and time value                                               |
| `hidden`       | Not shown to the user; value is auto-populated (see `autofill`)   |

#### Object Types

Types that need additional configuration MUST use an object form:

```jsonc
// Address with options
{ "type": "address", "ens": true, "addressBook": true }

// Token amount for a specific token
{ "type": "token-amount", "tokenAddress": "0x..." }

// Generic fixed-point amount (oracle price, share price, accounting unit)
{ "type": "amount", "decimals": 8, "symbol": "USD" }

// Token ID for a specific NFT collection
{ "type": "token-id", "tokenAddress": "0x..." }

// Enum -- display: show label, input: render as select dropdown
{ "type": "enum", "values": { "0": "Pending", "1": "Active" } }

// Slider -- input: render as range slider
{ "type": "slider", "min": "0", "max": "9999", "step": "1" }
```

#### Amount-like Types

`eth`, `gwei`, `token-amount`, and `amount` share one formatting contract -- **display value = raw integer / 10^decimals**, rendered with a symbol. They differ only in where `decimals` and `symbol` come from:

| Type           | decimals                       | symbol                  | asset                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `eth`          | 18 (fixed)                     | ETH (fixed)             | native                  |
| `gwei`         | 9 (fixed)                      | gwei (fixed)            | native                  |
| `token-amount` | on-chain `decimals()`          | on-chain `symbol()`     | token at `tokenAddress` |
| `amount`       | `decimals` field (default 18)  | optional `symbol` field | none                    |

Use `eth` or `token-amount` when the asset has an identity; use `amount` only for fixed-point numbers with no asset -- oracle outputs, share prices, internal accounting units.

### Autofill

The `autofill` field specifies a source to pre-populate an input with. It is separate from `type` -- one describes the value, the other controls the default.

#### String Autofill Values

| Value               | Meaning                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `connected-address` | User's connected wallet address  |
| `contract-address`  | This contract's address          |
| `zero-address`      | The zero address (`0x000...000`) |
| `block-timestamp`   | Current block timestamp          |

#### Object Autofill Values

For literal constants:

```json
{ "type": "constant", "value": "86400" }
```

A parameter MAY combine `type` and `autofill`:

```json
"from": {
  "label": "from",
  "type": "address",
  "autofill": "connected-address"
}
```

### Groups

Actions MAY be organized into named groups. Each group MUST have a `label` and SHOULD have an `order` for display sorting:

```json
{
  "groups": {
    "marketplace": { "label": "Marketplace", "order": 1 },
    "bidding": { "label": "Bidding", "order": 2 },
    "ownership": { "label": "Ownership", "order": 3 }
  }
}
```

Individual actions, events, errors, and messages MAY also have an `order` field to control display order within their group (or among ungrouped items). Lower numbers appear first. Items without an `order` are sorted after ordered ones.

### Intent Templates

Actions MAY include an `intent` template -- a human-readable sentence rendered with formatted parameter values:

```json
{
  "actions": {
    "composite": {
      "function": "composite",
      "title": "Composite",
      "intent": "Composite Check #{tokenId} with #{burnId}",
      "params": {
        "tokenId": {
          "label": "Keep Token ID",
          "preview": {
            "image": "eip155:1/erc721:0x036721e5a769cc48b3189efbb9cce4471e8a48b1/{tokenId}"
          }
        },
        "burnId": {
          "label": "Burn Token ID",
          "preview": { "image": "ipfs://Qme/{burnId}" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After the user fills in parameters, the intent renders as: **"Composite Check #4200 with #8000"**. Placeholders use `{paramName}` syntax. Prefix with `#` to prepend a hash symbol (e.g. `#{tokenId}` renders as `#4200`). Values MUST be formatted using their `type` before insertion.

### Parameter Previews

Parameters MAY include a `preview` object to show a visual preview as the user fills in values. The `image` field specifies a URI template that resolves to an image for the current parameter value:

```json
"preview": { "image": "eip155:1/erc721:0x036721e5a769cc48b3189efbb9cce4471e8a48b1/{tokenId}" }
```

URI templates use `{paramName}` interpolation -- the same syntax as intent templates. Supported URI formats:

| Format      | Example                                    | Use case                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| CAIP-19 URI | `eip155:1/erc721:0x036.../{tokenId}`       | ERC-721 NFT image resolved via token metadata    |
| CAIP-29 URI | `eip155:1/erc1155:0x28959.../{tokenId}`    | ERC-1155 token image resolved via token metadata |
| IPFS URI    | `ipfs://Qme/{tokenId}`                     | Off-chain image stored on IPFS                   |
| HTTPS URI   | `https://example.com/images/{tokenId}.png` | Conventional hosted image                        |

Consumers SHOULD resolve CAIP-19 and CAIP-29 URIs by fetching the token's metadata (e.g. via `tokenURI` or `uri`) and extracting the image. IPFS and HTTPS URIs resolve directly to the image content.

### Interface Includes

Common interface metadata (ERC-20, ERC-721, etc.) can be defined once and included by contract files:

```json
{
  "includes": ["interface:erc721", "https://example.com/metadata.json"],
  "$schema": "https://1001-digital.github.io/contract-metadata/v1/schema.json",
  "chainId": 1,
  "address": "0x036721e5a769cc48b3189efbb9cce4471e8a48b1",
  "name": "Checks Originals",
  "actions": {
    "mint": { "...": "..." },
    "composite": { "...": "..." }
  }
}
```

Includes support two formats:

- **`interface:` prefix** -- references a named interface file in the `interfaces/` subdirectory relative to the `$schema` URL (e.g. `"interface:erc721"` resolves to `interfaces/erc721.json` next to the schema file). These files contain `groups`, `actions`, `events`, `errors`, and `messages`. Interface files MAY ship curated variant actions (e.g. ERC-20 ships `revoke`, `approve-max`, `my-balance`, `my-allowance` alongside the base actions).
- **URL** -- fetches the metadata file from the given URL. The resolved file can live anywhere and follows the same structure.

Multiple includes merge left-to-right. Contract-specific metadata is then applied on top.

#### Merge Semantics

The merge is _shallow per top-level key within each section_. When a contract defines an action that also exists in an included interface, the contract's entire action object replaces the interface's. There is no deep merge of `params`, `returns`, or other nested fields. This means if you override an action, you MUST re-declare everything you want to keep (params, returns, types, etc.).

```
# Merge order for includes: ["interface:erc20", "interface:erc721"]
1. Start with empty {}
2. Merge erc20.json    -> { actions: { transfer: {from erc20}, approve: {from erc20}, revoke: {from erc20} } }
3. Merge erc721.json   -> { actions: { transfer: {from erc721}, approve: {from erc721}, revoke: {from erc721}, ownerOf: {from erc721} } }
4. Merge contract file -> { actions: { transfer: {from contract}, approve: {from erc721}, revoke: {from erc721}, ownerOf: {from erc721}, mint: {from contract} } }
```

### EIP-712 Message Metadata

Off-chain signing flows (Permit, Seaport orders, etc.) MAY be described with the `messages` object:

```json
{
  "messages": {
    "Permit": {
      "title": "Token Permit",
      "description": "Approve a spender to transfer your tokens without a separate approve transaction.",
      "warning": "This grants token spending permission. Verify the spender address carefully.",
      "intent": "Permit {spender} to spend {value} of your tokens until {deadline}",
      "fields": {
        "owner": { "label": "owner", "type": "address" },
        "spender": { "label": "spender", "type": "address" },
        "value": { "label": "amount", "type": "eth" },
        "nonce": { "label": "nonce" },
        "deadline": { "label": "deadline", "type": "timestamp" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Messages are keyed by EIP-712 primary type name and MUST be defined on the contract that verifies them. Each message supports the same enrichment as actions: `title`, `description`, `warning`, `intent`, and `fields` with the same parameter metadata (label, description, type).

### Extensions

Publishers MAY use custom extension objects on the root document, actions, events, errors, messages, and parameters. Extension names MUST start with an `_` character followed by a letter. Consumers that do not understand a given extension MUST ignore it.

```json
{
  "actions": {
    "colors": {
      "function": "colors",
      "title": "Check Colors",
      "description": "Get the colors of a given Check.",
      "params": {
        "tokenId": { "label": "Check", "type": "token-id" }
      },
      "_component": {
        "type": "color-map",
        "columns": "8"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Naming rules:**

- The extension name MUST begin with `_` followed by a letter (e.g. `_myapp`, `_component`).
- Extension names and their member keys MUST NOT contain `.` characters.
- Extensions SHOULD be named after a company, product, or feature to make their purpose clear.

No standard keys will ever begin with `_`, so the namespace is reserved for extensions.

## Rationale

### Why not extend NatSpec?

NatSpec is embedded in Solidity source code and targets developers. It cannot express semantic types, input guidance, or contract-level context like categories, risks, and audits. It is also unavailable for unverified contracts. A separate JSON format allows metadata to be authored, versioned, and served independently of the contract source.

### Why semantic types instead of just labels?

Labels help humans but not machines. A label "Price" on a `uint256` still doesn't tell a wallet whether to format the value as ETH, display a date picker, or show an NFT preview. Semantic types enable consumers to render appropriate UI automatically.

### Why shallow merge for includes?

Deep merging creates ambiguity about which nested fields take precedence and makes it difficult to reason about the final result. Shallow merge per action key is predictable: if you override an action, you own the entire definition. This mirrors how interface implementation works in most programming languages.

### Why three key formats (name, signature, selector)?

Bare names are the common case and the most readable. Signatures are needed for overloaded functions. Selectors are needed for unverified contracts where no ABI is available. Supporting all three covers the full spectrum of real-world contracts.

### Why decouple actions from ABI functions?

Keying metadata directly by ABI name creates a 1:1 coupling that cannot express common user intents. "Revoke Approval" is conceptually distinct from "Approve" in the user's mental model, but both compile down to the same `approve(address,uint256)` call with different arguments. Decoupling actions from ABI functions lets publishers express these intents as first-class UI entries with their own title, warning, intent template, and locked parameter values -- while still resolving to the correct ABI function at call time. It also unlocks calldata-to-action matching for transaction previews.

### Why describe `msg.value`?

A payable call is not fully described by its arguments -- `WETH.deposit()` takes no parameters at all, yet the single most important fact about it is how much ETH is attached. Without a `value` object, the best a publisher can do is warn about it in prose, which no wallet can render as an input or verify in a preview. Treating transaction value like a parameter (same label/autofill/lock semantics) closes that gap with no new concepts.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP introduces a new metadata format and does not modify any existing standards. It is fully complementary to ABIs, NatSpec, ERC-7572, and EIP-7730.

Contract-level fields (`name`, `symbol`, `description`, `image`, `banner_image`, `featured_image`, `external_link`, `collaborators`) are placed at the top level to maintain backwards compatibility with [ERC-7572](./eip-7572.md). A contract-metadata document with `name` present is a valid ERC-7572 `contractURI()` response -- existing consumers that understand only ERC-7572 will read the fields they recognize and ignore the rest.

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation including JSON Schema definitions and a validation script is available at [https://github.com/1001-digital/contract-metadata](https://github.com/1001-digital/contract-metadata).

The repository includes:

- `schema/contract-metadata.schema.json` -- JSON Schema for contract metadata files
- `schema/interface.schema.json` -- JSON Schema for interface files
- `schema/interfaces/` -- Reusable interface metadata (ERC-20, ERC-721)
- `contracts/` -- Example metadata files for deployed contracts
- `validate.ts` -- Schema and semantic validation script

## Security Considerations

### Metadata Integrity

Contract metadata is an off-chain resource. Consumers MUST NOT trust metadata blindly -- it could be outdated, incorrect, or malicious. Metadata SHOULD be served from authenticated sources and MAY be signed (via the `meta.signature` field) to allow consumers to verify authorship.

### Misleading Labels

A malicious metadata author could assign misleading labels or descriptions to functions (e.g. labeling a `transferFrom` as "Check Balance"). Consumers SHOULD display the underlying ABI function signature alongside any metadata-provided labels to allow users to verify.

### Intent Template Injection

Intent templates use `{paramName}` interpolation. Consumers MUST sanitize rendered intent strings to prevent injection attacks (e.g. XSS in web-based wallets). Parameter values MUST be treated as untrusted input during rendering.

### Extension Safety

Extensions are opaque to consumers that do not understand them. Consumers MUST ignore unknown extensions rather than attempting to interpret them. Extension authors SHOULD document their extensions and avoid storing sensitive data in extension fields.
